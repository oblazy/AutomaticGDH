# AutomaticGDH
Automatic tool to attack GDH protocols

## A word of warning:
Most of this code was written during my bachelor internship in 2006...
It is an implementation of the attack considered in : [PerQui06] [On the Impossibility of Building Secure Cliques-type Authenticated Group Key Agreement Protocols](https://perso.uclouvain.be/olivier.pereira/JCS05.pdf)
While i tried to update it, this is really ugly code... but functional

As of today (Nov 2022), it works with current OCaml version

I'll try to clean the code up a little...

## Use
Assuming a properly installed ocaml, simply run
> ocaml coeur.ml *filename*

Where filename is the name of your protocol .txt file without the extension.

The program will then run, and output a file filename.txt describing the interaction the attacker should do

## High level idea

GDH protocols are easily protocol.
* There is a generic attack for any protocol with 5+ users.
* It can directly be extended to 4 users, except in 9 cases (depending on who starts, and when they start using some seceets)
For those 9 cases, there are however another possible attacks.
**It should be noted, that those special cases are not the one highlighted in the original paper**
* For 3 cases, it's a mess...
    * There are cases with generic attacks possible
    * Cases where no attacks can be possible
    * And configurations where we could not find criterion. (In this case, the algorithm tries some bruteforce, sometimes finding attacks, sometimes showing there are known, and sometimes giving up because depth/breadth get too high)

## How to describe protocols

Each line contains one flow, of the form
> i - exponent > j

Meaning the user $i$ sends $g^\mathsf{exponent}$ to $j$.
Randomness are expressed as Ri (for example R1), if a user generates several randomness, one can write Ri,k (R1,2) for example.

It is possible for a user having received Ri,k from another to reuse it

One can assume the existence on long term keys between two users Ki|j (the | can be replaced by any non numeral / whitespace symbol). This is done to help parse K123 into K12|3 and K1|23.

Comments can be written on line beginning with %
 
Using ```==EOF== ``` somewhere in the file will end the processing, and allow to include extended comments.
